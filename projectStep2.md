##### Introduction

My name is Michael Eller and I'm writing to explain my project selection of a "Social Bulletin Board". The road leading to my selection was a long one. I had to contend with a plethora of ideas for different applications. Once the field was narrowed I had to decide which would make the largest impact, not only on me and my personal/professional growth, but for others around me and possibly the world. By the end of completion for this application I hope to grasp a firm understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and web deployment. I have a feeling this project will not disappoint in difficulty and will allow me to achieve the previous stated goals. Hopefully I will shed some light on the concept, what this application will do, how it will do it, and how I plan on completing it.

##### 1. Application Concept

Who still remembers the bulletin boards in there school or place of work? This used to be how we received all pertinent information we needed on a day to day basis. We used them to sign-up for classes, sports, study groups, etc. Today, that just isn't possible with the amount of information we want available and the limited space for such things, which brings me to my idea of a "Social Bulletin Board". We all know about Facebook, Twitter, mailing lists, and all the other social media platforms that try , some doing a great job, to bring information to the masses in an organized way. We also know that time and time again the information is lost or you have to swim through a black hole of data to find what's pertinent, that minute, to you. What if there was a way to do this with a graphic centric application that was totally customizable for what information and for who it was meant. This is my idea in a nut shell.

##### 2. The Data Phase

A bulletin board, in the traditional sense and by it's very nature, provides a vessel to display information. Those that have the information post it to the board in a graphically appealing manner. Then those without said information gaze upon the bulletin board and receive what information is relevant to them. The bad thing about the bulletin board was its surface area but today that is the best thing about it. Information can't be buried, and irrelevant information can be removed, replaced, or updated. A digital bulletin board, in theory, will receive, store and display relevant information graphically to those within it's instance. Meaning a neighborhood with an administrator/ HOA president and residents/users with privileges or a Business with its employees. There would be a database that would store user credentials, formatting information for the display, and information that needs to be displayed. Storage optimization is key so I am toying with the idea of only storing current data for the view state. In other words, once data has been replaced, deleted or updated then the old files are gone. We will see about that though.

##### 3. Programming Phase

To be honest, at this point, I'm at somewhat a loss for words when it comes to the programming aspect. This is probably due to my serious lack of knowledge in this area. Exactly the reason why I'm here though, to learn. I do, however, know I will have to create a database or storing the information required and information submitted for display. I will also have to create the GUI layout which seems like a design aspect but without a design you can't create. Security and ways to authenticate will also need to be incorporated, not only in the code, but in the database as well since it will hold user information. Hopefully in the next few weeks, this area will become a little clearer.

##### 4. The Functionality

Now, this is an area that I have given a great deal of thought. I 100% believe that an interface must be simple and intuitive. In this case the GUI will be the bulletin board itself. I plan to use something like tiles or maybe windows within to mimic tiles. This will give the administrator the ability to change the layout in order to place emphasis on whatever. I see a scrolling bar at the top, providing flash information, and an area where users can post (ex: for sale, yard sale, softball sign-up, etc). Lets take the example of a neighborhood that has deployed the bulletin board app. Assuming that everyone has it the HOA president would create the layout, adding areas specific to the neighborhood, that would be read only, allowing neighborhood to view things such as: minutes from the last meeting, copy of the by-laws, etc.. He would create space for general or specific postings by the residents i/e: yard sales, items for sale, group get togethers,etc.. He can then flash a message across the banner that HOA dues are due, urgent messages, or special messages, etc. Users could set up notifications and how to receive them when something is posted. There are a lot more functionality aspects but that's the once overall.

##### 5. Conclusion

The plan of attack for this laborious and technical project will consist of 4 phases: Conceptualization, defining my requirements, creating the pieces then testing and putting the pieces together for deployment. I understand that I will have set backs but I will reach out and siphon information from wherever and whoever I can in order to complete this monumental task. I plan to execute creation and testing as often as possible to ensure I have a stable product. I also plan to inquire throughout the development community for feedback and advice. In order to accomplish this mission I will need to create on piece at a time with interoperability in mind. Hopefully my plan of attack will carry me across the finish line. If not, then I will drag it across.
