# Database Presentation For The Modern Bulletin Board
---
 As I have introduced in previous documentation, A modern bulletin board system within a specified group has a multitude of useful and relevant applications. Special events, sign-up rosters, missing pets, reference documentation, etc. can all be implemented on this type of platform. I will focus on only a few for this project as proof of concept. In order to store this information, a database is a must. This particular database will consist of five tables: Users, SysLog, Events, Document, and login which I will briefly describe in the following paragraphs.

 #### Users
 This table establishes a users profile with the standard contact info, normally expected and is the entry table for the application/project. Most fields are set to Not Null to ensure the data needed populates. I decided to let the phone number column be null if the user so chooses but the email will be mandatiry. The userID will be the primary key.

 #### SysLog
 This table will be a container for all the system logs generated for exception handling, user logs that document sign-in, sign-out, document add, etc. The logID will be the primary key and the userID will be the foreign key. The userID feild will have a default of 'System' for logs not generated by users. This will prevent NULLs.

 #### Events
 This Table will Contain user added events and will be linked to the User table by userID and the Document Table by docID. Its important to note the relationship between the Document table and the Events table is that an event may have no or multiple documents but a document can only apply to one event. The primary key for this table will be the eventID and it will have two foreign keys of userID and docID.

 #### Documents
 This Table will house all the documents associated with an event. It will also have two foreign keys: userID to link to the User table and a eventsID to link to the Events table. docID will be set as the primary key.

 #### Login
 This table will house all the log in information for a user. The userName column will be the primary key while the UserID will be the foreign key. Its important to note that this table will require encryption and will only reference the Users table.

 #### Summary
 To summarize Constraints were used to re-enforce integrity and keys were implemented for table references.
